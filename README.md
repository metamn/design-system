<img src="src/design-system.png" width="100%" />

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@storybook/design-system.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/design-system) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Used by
- [Storybook homepage](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [LearnStorybook.com](https://www.learnstorybook.com/)
- [ChromaticQA.com](https://www.chromaticqa.com/)

Note: this design system is not used in Storybook's UI. The stack is different and theming requirements of Storybook add complexity beyond the scope of this project. However, Storybook's visual design is identical to what's here.

## Tech stack
Building components
- üìö [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) for UI component development and [auto-generated docs](https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-docs-sneak-peak-5be78445094a)
- üíÖ [Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for component-scoped styling
- ‚öõÔ∏è [React](https://reactjs.org/) declarative component-centric UI

Maintaining the system
- üì¶ [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for [packaging and distribution](https://blog.hichroma.com/how-packaging-makes-it-dead-simple-to-share-ui-components-29912593539d)
- ‚úÖ [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com/) to prevent UI bugs in components (by Storybook maintainers)
- üö• [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) Continuous integration

## Why 
The Storybook design system codifies existing UI components into a central, well-maintained repository. It is built to address having to paste the same components into multiple projects again and again. This simplifies building UI's with Storybook's design patterns.  

#### What we're doing
- Build and maintain a design system in the open
- Share UI components between multiple apps 
- Dogfood upcoming Storybook features 
- Welcome contributors of all levels and backgrounds


#### What we're not doing
- Rewrite all new components from scratch
- Overhaul the visual design of components
- Typescript (the consumer apps don't use it)
- Compete with more general design systems like ANT or Material.  

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @storybook/design-system
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import MyComponent from '@storybook/design-system';

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <MyComponent />;
  }
}
```

## Development Scripts

#### `yarn release`

> Bump the version

> Push a release to GitHub and npm

> Push a changelog to GitHub

_Notes:_

- Requires authentication with [`npm adduser`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser.html)
- [`auto`](https://github.com/intuit/auto) is used to generate a changelog and push it to GitHub. In order for this to work correctly, **an environment variable called `GH_TOKEN` is needed** that references a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with the appropriate permissions to update the repo.
